# mems-imu
mems-imu contains a set of scripts for evaluating  linear models in the context of MEMS inertial sensor errors. In particular the application of Time delayed Multiple Linear Regression models (TD-MLR), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Moving Average (MA)

A brief tech report about the results can be found in http://rpubs.com/harpomaxx/eaai2016brief2
